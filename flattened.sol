  * - locks collected funds and sold tokens, disallowing to withdraw them while in locked state
  * - sets immutable softcap in wei, which must be reached before contract can be unlocked
  * - creates two escrow contracts to accumulate collected funds
  * - before reaching softcap, funds will be held on "goal" escrow
  * - after reaching softcap, funds will be held on "raise" escrow
  * - provides method for manual unlocking after reaching softcap; if softcap has not been reached, unlock will not be possible
  * - after unlocking, tokens can be withdrawn to purchaser account; respectively, raised funds can be withdrawn to corporate account
  * - allows to finalize crowdsale, thus closing it in a way that tokens can't be bought anymore
  * - if the softcap has not been reached, finalized crowdsale allows to refund collected funds and return sold tokens to owner account
  * - sets corporate wallet address upon deployment; this is the account where raised funds will be sent to on withdrawal
  * - allows to update corporate wallet address
  * - sets token price in wei based on exchange rate of usd to eth
  * - sets minimum and maximum purchase allowances based on exchange rate of usd to eth
